## Introduction:
The global demand for food, energy, and water has surged due to population growth and rising affluence, creating complex interdependencies between these resources. Agriculture, a key driver of food production, significantly contributes to environmental degradation through greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and land use changes. This project seeks to analyse the environmental impact of various food products, focusing on factors such as carbon emissions, eutrophication, and resource utilisation. By leveraging data on 43 globally common foods across multiple environmental metrics, this analysis aims to uncover patterns and propose actionable recommendations for sustainable food systems.

## Business Problem:
The agricultural industry faces a dual challenge: meeting the growing food demand while minimising its environmental footprint. Policymakers, environmentalists, and food producers require data-driven insights to optimise food production methods and implement sustainable agricultural practices.

## Objective:
To analyse the environmental impact of food production at different lifecycle stages and provide recommendations for reducing carbon emissions, water usage, and land exploitation while ensuring food security.

## Analytical Questions:
- Which food products have the highest total carbon footprint across their production lifecycle?
- How do food transportation emissions vary based on the type of food product?
- How does land use change contribute to the overall greenhouse gas emissions of different food products?
- Which food products have the highest eutrophication impact, and how does this relate to their production methods?
- What is the correlation between water usage and carbon emissions across different food categories?
- How do animal-based and plant-based foods compare in terms of total carbon footprint and resource consumption?
- What are the most environmentally efficient foods in terms of resource utilisation per kg of production?
- Which stage of food production (i.e. farming, transportation, processing, etc) contributes the most to environmental impact?
- What policy recommendations can be derived from the data to reduce the environmental impact of food production?

## About the Dataset:
The dataset provides a comprehensive analysis of the environmental footprint of 43 commonly consumed food products. It covers multiple sustainability metrics, including greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water consumption, and eutrophication impact. The data spans the entire lifecycle of food production, from farming and processing to transportation and retail.

Each food item is evaluated based on its total environmental impact, allowing comparisons between plant-based and animal-based products. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and businesses aiming to reduce the ecological footprint of food production and promote sustainable agricultural practices.
